## What is Stevepy:

SounderPy is an open-source atmospheric science Python package for vertical profile analysis. This tool is designed to get data, ‘clean it up’ for simple use, and plot the data on advanced-sounding plots. SounderPy was developed with the goal in mind to keep the code simple and efficient for users of all experience levels and for reliability in all use cases.

SounderPy has been used by several institutions. For example, this tool has been implemented by the Des Moines National Weather Service Office, the State University of New York at Albany, Mississippi State University, and others. Many have used SounderPy in projects and papers, such as students at Ohio State University, Central Michigan University & Rizal Technological University.



## Why Stevepy?:

Mostly just because I thought it would be fun! Space weather is awesome.
